## üí° Inspiration -
We as a team are trying to use this concept of ‚Äúpublic forum‚Äù. We are trying to develop a web application that would be sort of Quora but specifically dedicated to college(s). In this crises situation, we as students went through lots of changes in learning styles and exam formats. Many new platforms, software, and apps were made available to us by the college but they were directed towards the use for student-teacher or class conversations. The main problem we are trying to solve is that the juniors don‚Äôt know about their seniors or vise versa and they have no means of establishing communication with them. That‚Äôs when the application of our software comes into the picture. As a public forum (email and logins provided by college) the new/old students can directly ask their questions and get them answered by seniors or alumni. The questions can be related to career guidance or help related to subjects etc. As our application would be hosted as a public forum it would help raise the SEO of the college on the internet. The questions related to the college could be found on the forum hence the transparency between the college and newcomers/ juniors is maintained.

## Ways to use this API -
1. [Pulling the API container image](https://ghcr.io/kaiwalyakoparkar/quora-for-college-api:latest)
2. [Forking/Clonning and running Scripts](https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/quora-for-college/tree/main/server/server#-forkingclonning-and-running-scripts--)

## üç¥ Forking/Clonning and running Scripts -
1. Follow the forking, clonning and local environment setup steps as [mentioned here](https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/quora-for-college/tree/main/server/server#Project-setup--contribution-steps)
2. Navigat to `/server` folder
3. Run `npm start` or `npm run start:dev` to start prod or dev environment as you like
4. Go to your api testing tool or application where you need to use this api
5. Implement the [Routes Available](https://github.com/kaiwalyakoparkar/quora-for-college/tree/main/server/server#-routes-available--)

## üê≥ Pulling the API container image -
1. Go to [Container Registray Page](https://ghcr.io/kaiwalyakoparkar/quora-for-college-api:latest)
2. Make sure you have docker download, installed and checked on their hello world image
3. Run Docker command `docker pull ghcr.io/kaiwalyakoparkar/quora-for-college-api:latest`
